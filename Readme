# Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their behavior and demographics using advanced unsupervised learning techniques. The dataset used is the **Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset**, which contains information about customers' age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique ID for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

The goal is to segment customers into meaningful groups using unsupervised learning techniques.

## Techniques Applied
The following advanced unsupervised learning techniques are applied to the dataset:

1. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
   - Used for density-based clustering and outlier detection.
   - Does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering with Dendrograms**
   - Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to visualize relationships between data points.
   - Uses Agglomerative Clustering to group similar data points.

3. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
   - A probabilistic model that assumes data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
   - Useful for soft clustering (assigning probabilities to clusters).

4. **t-SNE for Dimensionality Reduction**
   - A powerful technique for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D while preserving local relationships.

5. **Autoencoders for Feature Extraction**
   - Neural networks that learn compressed representations of data.
   - Used for dimensionality reduction or feature extraction before clustering.

## Code Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `tensorflow`.

### Steps to Run the Code
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow

# Run the Code:

- Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, GMM).

- Use dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE).

- Train an autoencoder for feature extraction.
